# Sudoku
'Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.' [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

App uses [Sudoku.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sudoku-umd) library to generating and solving sudoku puzzle.

You can:
* play a game with six levels of difficulty (from 'easy' to 'inhuman')
* check, reset and solve the current board
* get candidates for each tile (i.e. '137')

Further development:
* saving full state of the game to a string
* loading state of the game
